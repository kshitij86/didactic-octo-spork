1. choice always given
2. overlapping subproblem

one function call -> never DP applied
always >= 2 function calls, then DP applied
optimal, min, max, largest asked (max profit etc.)

parent of DP -> recursion
first recursive solution, then memoize, then top-down

types of problems -
1. 0/1 knapsack, subset sum, equal sum partition, count of subset sum 
2. unbounded knapsack
3. fibonacci
4. LCS
5. LIS
6. Kadane's algo
7. MCM
8. DP on trees
9. DP on Grid (robot only move down or right, how many ways?)
10. others
